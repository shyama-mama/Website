As the Vice President of SOMI, I form potential connections to company and start-up representatives that can benefit our society's upcoming projects. I also overlook newsletter and organise catering for our events. I have been working with SOMI since 2016. I am currently a third year student studying Mechatronics and Biomedical Engineering. My future career will be owning multiple forms of businesses to advance the health industry.
