Hi I'm Natasha, I'm doing Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at UNSW. I've been with SOMI for 3 years now and I'm like its godmother seeing it grow, take some stumbles and mature a lot over the years. As the treasurer of SOMI, I manage the team's expenditure and the flow of money in and out of the society. I also work with various contacts for upcoming events.
