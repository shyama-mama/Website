I am Sophie Yadana, the president of SOMI with a strong passion for medical technology. I deal with team leading, rebranding the society by strategising and executing new opportunities with industry partners for members of SOMI. I set out the year by raising the social awareness of the group and the business and organisation contacts we have in the med tech field. For sponsorships, joint events, or anything medtech, feel free to reach out for exciting opportunities.
